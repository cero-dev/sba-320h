# Marvel Character Database

This application connects to the Marvel API, to allow for character lookup, and once you have found the character you wanted, it generates a new page that gives a short description of the character and notable comic books associated with the character.

# Technologies Used

I used vite + react, with the react-router-dom to allow for two views, the Main search page, and the second view that appears once you click on a character, giving a detailed look at a specific person from marvel comics. I also used Axios, for requesting the data for a clean and modern approach.

# Instructions

Go to the Deployed Site: https://sba-320h.onrender.com/
All you have to do is start typing a marvel character
Ex:
Spider-Man,
Iron Man,
Hulk,
Wolverine,
Ben Parker,
The list should start populating, and then you just need to click on a character and it will take you to a detail page about the character and a button at the bottom to go back to the search page.
